Task-1:- Iris Flower Classification

Here we are given a dataset of the measurements of petals and sepals of the Iris Flowere Species. Using this dataset we have to train the model to predict which of the sub-species of each row of data
I have used the K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm to make the model.
By using KNN I have succesfully predicted the sub-species with an accuracy of 92.11%
